        <p>
          Alliance Francophone of the Palm Beaches mission is to offer
          cross-cultural opportunities to build harmonious and diverse
          relationships and to promote understanding and mutual respect for the
          cultural diversity within the Palm Beach community.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are more than 300 million people in the world who share the
          language and culture of France, from countries such as Canada,
          Switzerland, Algeria, Lebanon, Belgium, and Haiti. The population of
          Palm Beach County comprises a large group of these multicultural
          families whose first language is not English and who and are in need
          of a collective outlet to share their experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, as fellow Francophone’s, we hope to develop projects in
          aid of impoverished communities in French speaking countries. There
          are over 70 countries around the world that speak French and most of
          them are struggling. Finally, our mission is to preserve the cultures,
          languages and communities in Francophone countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alliance Francophone provides a comprehensive array of culturally
          relevant opportunities to bridge the gap. We offer free French
          literacy classes, lectures by notable authors, movies, museum events,
          informative communal dinners and linkage to Francophone branches
          throughout the world to children and adults in the Palm Beach County
          community.
